Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  - [Here](https://lonelybuddy.github.io/404-not-found/)
- What was your experience?
  It was really hard for me to decide the layout of the page, but I managed to make it happen, very slowly...
- What have you learned/improved?
  Always go mobile first!
